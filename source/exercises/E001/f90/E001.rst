E001 - Getting Started
======================

In this exercise, you learn about some basic concepts of programming, commonly used tools, and how to write and execute a script. You may come across some important vocabulary that you are not yet familiar with. **We will explore this with modern Fortran (programming language).**

.. topic:: What to Submit

      Submit your script for the final task of this exercise. The script should be named *[your student number]_e001.[ext]*, where *[ext]* is the file extension. In case of Python, this would be *.py*, for modern Fortran it is *.f90*, etc.


Workflow Setup
--------------

Fortran is a compiled language. Hence, our process will be: **write code > compile code > run executable file**. This means we will need the following tools to set up our workflow:

- We will write our code in a text editor with code-highlighting feature. For demonstration purposes, we will use `Kate <https://apps.kde.org/en-gb/kate/>`_. However, there are many great editors (e.g., `Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_).

   :align: center

   Text editors like *Kate* support code highlighting, which will make your code much easier to read!

- We will execute our compiled programme from command line in a terminal emulator (also referred to as console in this document). There are many great options. If you are using any Linux or Unix operating system (incl. MacOS), you will most likely have a terminal emulator already installed. If you're using Windows, installing `Cygwin <https://www.cygwin.com/>`_ is recommended. For this tutorial, demonstrations will be done with KDE's `Konsole <https://konsole.kde.org/>`_ and *bash* shell (command-line interpreter). For the exercises here, you do not need to know *bash* commands well. You only need to know 3 commands:

    1. *ls* lets you view the content of your working directory (the folder  you are currently in). *ls -l* will list the contents line-by-line.
    2. You can find out which directory you are in by typing *pwd* (short for "print working directory").
    3. *cd* will change the directory you are working in. It is the equivalent of opening a folder in your file browser. For example: If you are currently in a folder *home/* that contains a subfolder named *doge/*, you can navigate to the subfolder by typing *cd doge*. If you want to navigate one folder level up, you simply type *cd ..*.

   *Konsole* is one of many well-established terminal emulators. The image demonstrates some useful bash commands. The commands are written in lines starting with $ and executed by hitting enter. The results of the commands are displayed in the other lines below them.

- We will compile our code with the `gfortran <https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/>`_ compiler (version 10). Additional installation instructions can be found `here <https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/>`_. The simplest way to compile your Fortran code with gfortran is by typing the following into your terminal emulator:

.. code-block:: bash

    gfortran [path1]/[code].f90 -o [path2]/[program].exe
    ./[program].exe

With the command in the first line, you are telling the compiler to compile your script with file name *[code]* located in the folder *[path1]* and create an executable file with file name *[program]* in the folder *[path2]*. The second line will run your progam. If you are working on a Linux/Unix system, you do not need the *.exe* file extension, but it may help you identify your executables.


Writing and Compiling a Simple Programme
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: fortran

    program printing
    implicit none

    print *, "wow, many print"

    end program

If you compile and execute the programme as described above, the line *"wow, many print"* should be displayed in your terminal emulator. Let's go through the programme in detail to examine what it does:

- Your first line is the start of the programme, which you named *"printing"*. The last line (*"end pgoram"*) is how you end every programme you write.
- Virtually every modern Fortran programme will have the *"implicit none"* statement above any instructions given by the programme to the computer. You are telling Fortran not to assume any specific data type for a variable based on the variable name. We'll have a look at variables and data types later. For now, the following explanation is enough: Fortran is a very special language in that it is (a) quite old, (b) continuously updated, and (c) modern versions of the language remain compatible with old Fortran. This line ensures continued backward-compatibility.
- The actual instructions tell your computer to print (i.e. display on screen/in your terminal emulator) the words put in quotation marks. The asterisk (*) tells the computer to display/print the text in default format. The comma seperates the command (on the left side) from the words to be printed (on the right side).
