E105 - A Simple Climate Model
=============================

This exercise will not be related to statistics. Instread, you get the chance to write your very own, simple "climate model" that calculates the temporal evolution of the mean temperature of Earth for different simplified, idealised Earths. 

Background
----------

Preparation for this exercise will only require the close study of the contents of previous lectures. Make sure you are familiar with the concepts of **black body radiation**, **radiative fluxes**, **Stefan Boltzman Law**, **heat capacity** and **dynamic equilibrium**.

The essential topics are covered in the :doc:`Building a Climate III<../../lectures/A003/A003>`.

.. topic:: What to Submit

      Use the skeleton script below (or create your own in your preferred language) and add your lines of code where prompted. Submit the same script with your own code. The script should be named *[your student number]_e105.[ext]*, where *[ext]* is the file extension. In case of Python, this would be *.py*, for modern Fortran it is *.f90*, etc. Furthermore, submit the figure(s) of temperature evolution your script calculates.

   The concept of black body radiation is essential in understanding radiative fluxes (the input and output) of Earth. Specifically, it lets us calculate the nature of incoming and outgoing radiation, as well as the mean global temperatures on Earth or any planet if the whole system is in equilibrium.

Study the script below. Certain parameters are already defined for you. Follow the instructions of the script carefully and add your own code where asked. The final script will be able to calculate the temporal evolution of mean global temperatures on different simplified and idealised versions of Earth until an equilibrium is reached.
