INTEGRATE Teaching Package
==========================

INTEGRATE (*INTEGRation of Atmospheric science, Technical and Empirical methods*) is an open-access, open-source teaching package covers the topics of physical climatology, empirical methods and a hands-on approach of collecting and analysing atmospheric data. It is based on a workshop and lecture series taught by Sebastian G. Mutz at the University of TÃ¼bingen. Its further development was supported by the EGU Higher Education Teaching Grant 2020.
