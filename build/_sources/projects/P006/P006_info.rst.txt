Project P006
=============


Project Goals
-------------

Gain an overview of palaeo-climate change (for annual means of temperature, zonal and meridional winds) in South America. Specifically, you are investigating modes of change from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to pre-industrial (PI) times. 


Project Data
------------

You are basing your analysis on climate model simulation output for the two investigated time periods. Furthermore, you will need files for land-sea distribution for masking. The data will be provided in class.


Project Methods
---------------

Apply a hierarchical cluster analysis to the delta values (LGM-PI differences) of the annual means of your climate variables, decide on an optimal number of clusters (a cut-off number in the procedure) and plot your results.

**Optional**: Apply k-means clustering corrections to your results, i.e. use centroids from your hierarchical clustering as input for a k-means clustering procedure.
