The "source" folder contains course material for the module "Climate Dynamics, Probability and Statistics" (coordinator: Sebastian Mutz), taught at the University of TÃ¼bingen. It mostly consists of Python scripts and .rst files, which are compiled with sphinx into an instructional website (contained in the "_build" folder) for students.
