Version History
---------------

Note that the exercises in the P1 and P2 series are based on the ClimStat exercise series developed as part of the University of TÃ¼bingen geoscience module "Climate Dynamics, Probability and Statistics", which is still available `here <https://esdynamics.geo.uni-tuebingen.de/climstat/index.html>`_. It is therefore credited as version 0.9 in the INTEGRATE learning package.
