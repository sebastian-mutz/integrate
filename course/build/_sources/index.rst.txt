INTEGRATE Lecture and Exercise Series
=====================================

The INTEGRATE (Integrated Teaching of Atmospheric Science, Technical/Computer Skills and Empirical Methods) teaching package covers the theory and hands-on approach of collecting atmospheric data and working with readily available climatological records on real problems using modern empirical methods. Resources produced will include slides and notes, a repository with instructions and materials for practical and projects, and short videos to assist instructors deliver the course.

Welcome to **ClimStat**, the exercise series of the **Climate Dynamics, Probability and Statistics** course offered at the University of TÃ¼bingen. The course teaches the basics of (Python) programming, statistics, and the application of machine learning techniques (to problems in climatology). The **course is open to everyone** interested in learning about these topics and techniques. To see if you are eligible for supervision and ECTS credits, consult our information on :doc:`eligibility criteria<general/info>`.
