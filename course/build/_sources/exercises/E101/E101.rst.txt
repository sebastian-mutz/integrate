=======

In the accompanying lecture to this exercise, you learned about the implications of the the central limit theorem, standard error and confidence intervals. This exercise is designed to give you some practice in working with these concepts to give you a more intuitive grasp of them.

.. topic:: What to Submit

      Submit your script(s) and 1-2 sentence answers to the questions for the tasks of this exercise via ILIAS. You may include the answers as comments in your script(s). Make sure to also comment each of your calculations (using the terminology you were introduced to). The script should be named *[your surname]_e101.[ext]*, where *[ext]* is the file extension. In case of Python, this would be *.py*, for Matlab it is *.m*, etc.

.. note:: For this exercise, we'll take a frequentist approach to probability and uncertainty.

Temperatures in the Atacama      
---------------------------

The Atacama desert is the driest place on Earth, and it can also get a little warm. Through careful experimentation, namely GCM (General Circulation Model) simulations, you were able to construct two models in form of PDF's (probability density functions) for summer temperatures in this desert. The simulations represent two very possible regional climate scenarios. Model 1 has a mean of 24.2°C and standard deviation of 6.1°C. Model 2 has a mean of 25.9°C and standard deviation of 5.5°C. A study suggested that mean summer temperatures above 23°C are related to increased health risks in the local population. The budget of the local goverment is large enough to keep the population healthy if the mean summer temperatures for the 30 year planning period do not exceed 24.5°C. 

What is the probability of the local government running out of money within the given period and for each of the two regional climate scenarios? 


Sampling Strategy - Reversing the Problem
-----------------------------------------

You're planning a field campaign to the Alps to collect samples of carbonates to reconstruct mean annual temperatures (MAT) for the Middle Miocene, and through some groundbreaking research, those carbonates are now able to adequately represent palaeo-MAT. You have limited time and resources, but still want to end up with a large enough sample size to be able to conduct decent research. More specifically, you want to have a sample number that allows you to be 95% confident that your true Middle Miocene MAT lies within 0.5°C of your sample mean. Temperatures constructed from similar samples of a pilot study have a standard deviation of 1.1°C.

How many samples are you planning to take?
