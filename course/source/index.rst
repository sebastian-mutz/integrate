INTEGRATE Teaching Package
==========================

INTEGRATE (*Integrated Teaching of Atmospheric Science, Technical Skills and Empirical Methods*) is an open-access, open-source teaching package covers the topics of physical climatology, empirical methods and a hands-on approach of collecting and analysing atmospheric data. It was forked from a University of TÃ¼bingen module developed and taught by Sebastian G. Mutz. Its further development was supported by the EGU Higher Education Teaching Grant 2020.
