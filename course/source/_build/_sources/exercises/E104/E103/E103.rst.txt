The Bayes theorem allows you to **learn** from new data and update your knowlege about a system/model/hypothesis. In the accompanying lecture to this exercise, you learned about the Bayes theorem and one of its many applications. This exercise is designed to introduce you to a different use for the same theorem in order to give you a more intuitive grasp of it.

.. topic:: What to Submit

      Submit your script(s) and 1-2 sentence answers to the questions for the tasks of this exercise via ILIAS. You may include the answers as comments in your script(s). Make sure to also comment each of your calculations (using the terminology you were introduced to). The script should be named *[your surname]_e103.[ext]*, where *[ext]* is the file extension. In case of Python, this would be *.py*, for Matlab it is *.m*, etc.

Bayesian Categorisation - Assigning Data to a Location     
------------------------------------------------------

You are provided with data from three different (southern hemisphere) weather stations with different latitudinal and similar longitudinal coordinates: 

Central Chile:
:download:`Antofagasta.cvs <Antofagasta.csv>`   

Central-South Chile: 
:download:`Quintero.cvs <Quintero.csv>`   

South Chile:
:download:`Puerto_Montt_el_Tepual.cvs <Puerto_Montt_El_Tepual.csv>`   

.. figure:: winds.jpg  

.. note:: It is common practice in climatology to separate wind vectors into their meridional (along longitudes) and zonal (along latitudes) components. Those are denoted as v-winds and u-winds respectively.  

For this exercise, you can assume that the wind directions at the locations of the weather stations represent fairly typical wind directions at these latitudes and are not affected much by local near-surface geographical disparities. Consequently, the station data is suitable for constructing models for wind directions at the three different latitudes. 

Additionally, you are given a few different data points (of unknown origin) for June wind directions: 
11.4°, -30.8°, 60.2°

You are interested in the latitudes the winds were probably measured at. Use Bayes theorem to update the probabilities for the wind direction models (see above) based on the wind direction data you are given.

**HINT**

* Think carefully about how to take seasons into consideration when constructing your wind direction model.
