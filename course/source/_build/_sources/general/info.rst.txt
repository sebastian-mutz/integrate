General
=======

This page contains general information for the University of Tübingen geoscience module "Climate Dynamics, Probability and Statistics" (M322). 6 ECTS module credits are awarded. 

Short Description
-----------------
This module teaches the physics of atmospheric processes, climate change of the past, present and future, and theoretical and practical knowledge of probability theory and statistics. Students will gain a solid understanding of basic and advanced statistical methods and their implementation (Python or other). These methods are transferable to other (geo)scientific disciplines and complement those taught in “Applied Data Analysis and Models for Geoscientists” (M317, Dr. R. Drews). 
The module is taught in English and Python. However, students may complete all exercises with their preferred programming language (Matlab, Fortran, C, etc.) and plotting tools. 

Learning Goals
--------------

.. topic:: Climate Dynamics:
  
    * processes governing the climate system on different scales;
    * physics- and statistics-based modelling of the atmosphere;
    * climate change of the past, present and future;    

.. topic:: Statistics and Probability - Mathematical Modelling under Uncertainty:

    * fundamental concepts of frequentist and Bayesian probabilities and statistics;
    * data handling: from high dimensionality to sparse records;
    * machine learning and self-improving models (models learning from data)

Instructors
-----------

* **Sebastian Mutz** (Dr. rer. nat., atmospheric science & statistics)
* **Willi Kappler** (Dipl.-Inf., scientific computing & software development)
  
Course meetings
---------------

.. topic:: We meet here:

    * Lectures: Mondays 14:00-16:00, Room S246

    * Exercises: Thursdays 10:00-12:00, Room S310


Languages
---------

* The course is taught in **English**, but German is possible for 1-on-1 explanations.
* The course is taught in Python, but participants are free to use **any language** they prefer (Matlab, Fortran, C, etc.).
