Grading
=======

**Grades will be based on an oral presentation of group projects**, which involve the application of a machine-learning technique to a specific problem in science. Students will demonstrate their understanding of the scientific problem and the method by:

* **Rubric 1 - understanding science**: 
  Describing the scientific problem and its implication for science and society;   
* **Rubric 2 - understanding method application**: 
  Justifying the application of the method to this particular problem; 
* **Rubric 3 - understanding method and code**: 
  Explaining the method and its code implementation;
* **Rubric 4 - holistic and in-depth understanding**: 
  Adequately answering questions asked by the instructors and a guest scientist (examiner);
* **Rubric 5 - students' learning goals**: 
  The fifth grading rubric is decided on with the students, and is based on the students' learning goals. This may either be an adjustment of weighting of the rubrics above or an entirely new rubric (such as soft skills for presentation).

.. warning:: No late submissions accepted!

    Timely submissions of all exercises via ILIAS are a requirement for passing the course. No late submissions of exercises or projects will be accepted, unless you are unable to finish due to illness. 
    
.. warning:: Lecture attendance strongly recommended!    
    
    Lecture attendance is no requirement for passing, but will strongly benefit the students' understanding of the science and method of their graded projects and likely affect the final grade.
