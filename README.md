INTEGRATE (Integrated Teaching of Atmospheric Science, Technical/Computer Skills and Empirical Methods) is an open learning package supported by the EGU higher education teaching grant 2020 awarded to S.G. Mutz

# Description of Teaching Package
The INTEGRATE teaching package promotes an interdisciplinary and didactically multifaceted approach to learning about climatology, modern empirical methods and programming. It comprises a crash course in theory and hands-on approach to collecting atmospheric data and working with readily available climatological records on real problems using modern empirical methods. This course requires no prior knowledge of the topics covered in the course. 
The package includes four phases. 

- Phase 1: Students are introduced to fundamentals of atmospheric processes. Students simultaneously complete exercises on basic programming skills (required for Phase 2). 
- Phase 2: Students explore advanced topics in climatology, empirical methods and their intersections by applying basic statistical methods learned in Phase 1 to solve climatological problems. The exercise series uses a "flipped classroom" approach. 
- Phase 3 (field/lab work): Students put into practice all skills learned in Phase 1-2 by building, programming and using atmospheric measurement systems to collect and analyse their own weather datasets. This includes sensor installation and programming on a Raspberry Pi (mini computer).
- Phase 4 - Projects & Evaluation: For final projects, students select and apply an advanced method (e.g., Random Forests) to tackle a real problem in climatology (e.g. climate change attribution). Successful project completion requires understanding of climatological theory (Phases 1-2), theoretical knowledge of the method (Phases 1 and 2), programming skills (Phase 1) and collected data (Phase 3) for project implementation. Studentsâ€™ learning is assessed based on the project work and their communication of the problem, its scientific context and solution. 

# Resources
The following resources are included in the package: (1) all presentation slides and notes (integrated into the website), (2) instructions and materials for practicals and final projects (including solutions to posed problems, data and code), and (3) short video instruction to support instructors with the course package.
